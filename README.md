# School_District_Analysis
Using Anaconda to analyze test scores for a school district

## Overview of the school district analysis

We conducted an analysis of academic performance across fifteen high schools in Maryland. We were informed that the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School were compromised, and thus needed to reconduct the analysis without those scores. The following is our summary of the analysis and recommendations.

## Results
